# Embedding Trajectories experiments

This repo is a place for us to experiment (research woo!) with different ideas
about semantic trajectories, genAI, embeddings,
[TDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis) and more.

On Ben's TODO list is to come up with a coherent one-pager about the scope of
this research vision, but suffice to say that he's pretty excited about it.

## Repo structure

- `fake-panic/` contains a couple of python scripts for running a "fake" version
  of Panic (Panic itself is in a separate repo, ask [Ben](ben.swift@anu.edu.au)
  if you need access).

- `lit-trajectories/` contains python scripts for chunking + embedding classic
  texts from **The Canon**^TM and looking at their trajectories in embedding
  space.

There will be more subfolders as we come up with more experiments---although we
can also share code between experiments too. For now, just get stuff done and we
can refactor as we go.

See the READMEs in each subfolder for more info about each project.
